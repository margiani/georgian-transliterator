# Georgian Text Transliterator

https://getr.netlify.app

I created this tool for slow readers in Georgian like myself. While I am in the process of learning the language, I can only read quickly in transliteration. I don't like the existing methods of transliteration of Georgian writing, so I created my own, which I find more intuitive for people speaking European languages. To represent specific Georgian consonants, I borrowed symbols from the International Phonetic Alphabet, the Lepsius Standard Alphabet, Abkhazian and Western Slavic languages.
